2.)
    a.)
        The program iterates through the array arr of 16-bit integers,
        treating 0 as a sentinel to mark the end. It keeps track of the
        previous value (starting from 0) and, for each element, computes
        the absolute value of the difference between the current element
        and the previous element, then accumulates that into [d].
        For arr = [5, 50, 20, 30, 0], the final value stored in [d] is 120.

        In general, if the array elements are a0, a1, ..., ak with ak = 0
        as the sentinel, then:
            [d] = |0 - a0| + Σ (from i = 1 to k) |ai - a(i-1)|

    b.)
        The array uses 0 as a sentinel value. On each iteration the code
        loads the current element into edx and executes:
            cmp edx, 0
            jne loop
        When edx == 0 (the sentinel), the comparison is equal and the
        jump is not taken, so the loop terminates.

    c.)
        Each array element is 2 bytes. This is indicated by the dw
        (define word) directive for arr, and by the code incrementing
        the pointer ecx by 2 each iteration.

    d.)
        d is 4 bytes. This is indicated by the dd (define doubleword)
        directive, which allocates a 32-bit value.

    e.)
        The array arr has 5 elements, each 2 bytes, so its total size
        is 5 × 2 = 10 bytes.

    f.)
        The program computes absolute values using the sequence:
            sub eax, edx     ; eax = previous - current
            jns L1           ; if result is non-negative, skip negation
            neg eax          ; if negative, negate to make it positive
        After this, eax holds |previous - current|. That value is then
        added into [d] with:
            add [d], eax

    g.)
        xor edx, edx is necessary so that edx starts at 0 before the loop.
        This ensures the first term contributes |0 - first_element| to [d],
        and also prevents any garbage value in edx from corrupting the
        computation or the sentinel comparison cmp edx, 0. Without
        zeroing edx, the logic of the program would be incorrect.
