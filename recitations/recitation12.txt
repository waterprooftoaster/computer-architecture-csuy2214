1. A page table is the data structure the CPU and OS use to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses.

2. Because virtual addresses are an abstraction, not a direct mapping to existing RAM. The OS and hardware let you pretend you have more memory than physically exists by using disk and page table.

3. The TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is a small, fast hardware cache that stores recent VPN → PPN translations. It sits between the CPU and the page-table hardware.
