1. 
  Both policies apply. 
  In write-through, each write is sent ot the cash and main memory simultaneously.
  In WRite-back, each write goes only to the cache. It is sent only to the main 
  memory when that cache row is evicted.

2. 
  Both policies apply.
  In write-around, the write is sent only to the main memory. 
  In write-allocate, the write is sent ot he cache. 

3.
  A fully associative casche with a size of 1 cell will use zero bits for both index
  and offset.
  We need 0 bits to represent the offsetm since each address is in its own block.
  If the cache is fully associative, there is only one row. So no need for indexing.

  a.
    31/32 = 96.875%
    The size of the cache does not impact the miss rate.
  b.
    0.03125
