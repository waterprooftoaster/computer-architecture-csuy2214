1. 
    Like an “if” statement: Both choose between alternatives based on a control signal.
    Unlike an “if” statement: The MUX performs a simultaneous hardware selection, while an “if” statement performs sequential execution in software.

2. PC is a 16 bit value and 7 bit cannot add to it. Only jeq uses this component.

3. SUBTRACT (A − B) during jeq.

4. 
    a. addi

        FUNCalu: 0 (perform addition for R[regSrc] + imm)

        MUXalu: 1 (second ALU input is the sign-extended immediate)

        MUXpc: 1 (non-jumping; PC <- PC+1)

        MUXrf: 0 (source register selector comes from the 2-reg format’s regSrc field at bits 12–10)

        MUXtgt: 0 (write back the ALU result)

        MUXdst: 0 (destination register is regDst at bits 9–7 in the 2-reg format)

        WErf: 1 (we write the result to the register file)

        WEdmem: 0 (no store to memory)
